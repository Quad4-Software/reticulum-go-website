# Identity and destinations

## Identity

A Reticulum identity is the root cryptographic principal for signing announces, establishing links, and encrypting identity-layer messages.

Implementation: `pkg/identity` with primitives from `pkg/cryptography`.

### Key material

| Component             | Size     | Purpose                |
| --------------------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| X25519 private scalar | 32 bytes | ECDH, identity encrypt |
| Ed25519 seed          | 32 bytes | Signing                |

Together these form the 512-bit keyset described in Reticulum documentation.

### Public form (64 bytes on wire)

```
X25519 public key (32 bytes) || Ed25519 public key (32 bytes)
```

Peers learn this blob from announces and proofs.

### Identity hash

SHA-256 over the 64-byte public key, truncated to 128 bits (16 bytes). Used for addressing, HKDF salt context, and storage paths.

### Software identity file (64 bytes on disk)

```
X25519 private (32) || Ed25519 seed (32)
```

Equivalent to Python `RNS.Identity` software persistence. Anyone with this file can impersonate the identity on the network. Store with restrictive permissions on encrypted media.

Load helpers:

```go
id, err := identity.LoadIdentityFile(path, nil)
```

### Identity backend (file, Secret Service, or kernel keyring)

Config key `identity_backend` in `[reticulum]`:

| Value            | Behavior                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `file` (default) | 64-byte plaintext identity files                                                                                               |
| `secretservice`  | Freedesktop Secret Service over D-Bus (GNOME Keyring, KDE Wallet Secret Service bridge, KeePassXC with Secret Service enabled) |
| `keyring`        | Linux kernel keyring (user keyring, no D-Bus). Suitable for headless systemd user or system units                              |

With `secretservice` or `keyring`, `ToFile` stores the private blob in the backend and writes an 8-byte `RSSI` marker at the usual path. `FromFile` and `LoadIdentityFile` detect the marker and fetch the secret. If the backend is unavailable, persistence fails with a clear error (no silent plaintext fallback).

`keyring` is Linux-only. When a persistent user keyring is available, material can survive reboot for the same UID. Otherwise keys are cleared on reboot. Desktop sessions without D-Bus can use `keyring` instead of `secretservice`.

Headless units that cannot use the kernel keyring should keep `identity_backend = file`, or unlock a Secret Service collection / KeePassXC before start when using `secretservice`.

CLI migrate (path via `-i`):

```
rgoid -i ~/.reticulum-go/storage/transport_identity -to-secretservice
rgoid -i ~/.reticulum-go/storage/transport_identity -to-keyring
rgoid -i ~/.reticulum-go/storage/transport_identity -to-file
```

### In-memory key handling

Long-term X25519 and Ed25519 material lives in `pkg/securemem` buffers with best-effort `mlock` and wipe on `Identity.Close`. Callers of `GetPrivateKey` should wipe the returned slice when finished.

### What this protects against

| Control                                                      | Helps against                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Does not stop                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `identity_backend = secretservice`                           | Casual theft of the identity file path (backup copies, world-readable home dirs, malware that only reads `~/.reticulum-go/storage`). Keyring unlock policies and KeePassXC master password raise the bar for offline disk images when the collection is locked. | Root or same-user malware that can talk to an unlocked Secret Service session. Compelled unlock. Physical access while the keyring is unlocked. |
| `identity_backend = keyring`                                 | Same file-path theft cases without requiring D-Bus. Fits systemd units that have a user keyring.                                                                                                                                                                | Root or same-UID processes that can call `keyctl`. Keys may not survive reboot if persistent keyring is unavailable.                            |
| `pkg/securemem` mlock + wipe                                 | Keys lingering in swap after process exit, casual core dumps of freed heap (with `RLIMIT_CORE=0` in the sandbox), accidental retention after `Close`.                                                                                                           | Live process memory inspection by root or a debugger attached to the running daemon. Full cold-boot attacks on RAM.                             |
| File permissions `0600` + encrypted disk (operator practice) | Other local users reading plaintext identity files. Disk theft when FDE is used and the volume is locked.                                                                                                                                                       | Attacks after the volume is unlocked and mounted.                                                                                               |

None of these replace HSM-backed signing (`RHB1` / `NewIdentityWithSigner`) for high-assurance signing material, or host firewall and sandbox policy for network exposure.

### Hardware-bound descriptor (RHB1, optional)

Reticulum-Go supports a 72-byte hardware-bound layout:

| Field          | Size     |
| -------------- | -------- |
| Magic `RHB1`   | 4 bytes  |
| Version        | 1 byte   |
| Reserved       | 3 bytes  |
| X25519 private | 32 bytes |
| Ed25519 public | 32 bytes |

Signing uses an external `cryptography.Ed25519Signer` (for example PKCS#11 or cloud HSM). The on-wire Ed25519 public key matches a software identity so Python peers require no changes.

Python `Identity.from_file` does not read RHB1 today. See [Compatibility](/docs/compatibility).

```go
id, err := identity.NewIdentityWithSigner(descriptor, signer)
```

### Identity encryption

Outbound encrypted tokens use ephemeral X25519, HKDF-SHA256, AES-256-CBC, and HMAC-SHA256. See [Cryptography](/docs/cryptography#identity-encryption).

### Ratchets

Optional X25519 ratchet keys rotate for forward secrecy on identity-encrypted traffic. Ratchets persist under `storage/ratchets/` per identity hash with expiry aligned to reference constants.

## Destinations

A destination is an application endpoint on the network. Implementation: `pkg/destination`.

### Destination types

| Type   | Constant | Use                             |
| ------ | -------- | ------------------------------- |
| Single | SINGLE   | One-to-one application endpoint |
| Group  | GROUP    | Group messaging                 |
| Plain  | PLAIN    | Unencrypted endpoint (rare)     |
| Link   | LINK     | Link-mode endpoint              |

### Destination hash

The on-wire destination hash is derived from application name, aspects, and identity hash (for non-plain types) using a truncated SHA-256 construction in `calculateHash`. The exact byte layout matches Python and is verified in `tests/crossref`.

### Creating a destination

```go
dest, err := destination.NewDestination(
    id,
    destination.TypeSingle,
    "myapp",
    "subsystem",
)
```

Register with transport so inbound packets route to `Destination.Receive`.

### Announces

Destinations publish signed announces so the network learns paths. Handlers register through `pkg/announce`:

```go
transport.RegisterAnnounceHandler(handler)
```

Announce payloads can carry application-specific `app_data` visible to peers.

### Request handlers

Destinations can register request paths. Incoming requests block the link goroutine until the handler responds or a timeout elapses. The control API exposes the same pattern over WebSocket events.

### Incoming links

Register with `accepts_links` semantics. Incoming link requests dispatch to `link.HandleIncomingLinkRequest`.

## Resolver

`pkg/resolver` resolves a human-readable full name string to a deterministic identity hash via SHA-256. Useful for configuration and display, not a substitute for trust on first use from announces.

## Storage layout

| Artifact           | Path                                   |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Identity blobs     | `storage/identities/` (per hash in Go) |
| Known destinations | `storage/known_destinations/`          |
| Ratchets           | `storage/ratchets/`                    |

Go writes identity files keyed by hash. Python may use per-name files. Go loads Python-format known destination files for interoperability.

## Signing without holding the seed

Integrate HSM or cloud KMS via `cryptography.NewEd25519SignerFromCryptoSigner`. The public Ed25519 key in announces must match the 64-byte public blob.

## Security practices

- Treat the 64-byte software file like a private key backup
- Use RHB1 when the signing key must not live in process memory
- Do not log identity material at high debug levels in production
- Rotate ratchets according to application policy and storage expiry
