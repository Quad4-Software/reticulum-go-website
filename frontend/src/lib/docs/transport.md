## Role

`pkg/transport` is the routing engine. It learns paths from signed announces, forwards packets across interfaces, maintains link table state, and delivers data packets to registered destinations.

Transport sits between interfaces and application destinations. Every enabled interface registers with `Transport.RegisterInterface`, which sets a callback from inbound frames to `HandlePacket`.

## Path table

The path table maps a 16-byte destination hash to:

- Next-hop interface name
- Hop count and timestamps
- Transport ID for multi-hop type-2 headers
- Interface-specific metadata

Paths are learned from:

- Signed announces received on interfaces
- Path response packets
- Explicit path requests from applications or the control API

### Path selection

When multiple paths exist, transport uses random-blob selection aligned with Python 1.3.4 deduplication behavior (`pkg/transport/path_selection.go`).

### Path requests

Applications call `RequestPath` on transport or use destination helpers. Ingress and egress controls (`pkg/rate`, `pkg/transport/ingress.go`) limit announce and path-request rates per interface configuration.

Unknown-path discovery (rebroadcasting a path request when no path is known) runs only when the receiving interface is in a discover mode (`access_point`, `gateway`, `roaming`, `internal`) or has `recursive_prs = yes` (RNS 1.3.6+).

Announce rebroadcast also applies interface mode filters (AP block, roaming/boundary/internal next-hop rules). See [Interfaces](/docs/interfaces).

### Persistence

By default the path table can persist to `storage/destination_table` as msgpack with a layout compatible with Python. Set `in_memory_path_table = yes` to keep paths in RAM only.

Known destinations persist under `storage/known_destinations/`. Set `in_memory_known_destinations = yes` for RAM-only mode.

## Packet handling

Inbound packets enter `HandlePacket` and branch on packet type:

```
HandlePacket
  |
  +-- Announce  -> handleAnnouncePacket
  |                 update path table, invoke announce handlers
  |
  +-- Link      -> handleLinkPacket
  |                 link setup, identify, keepalive
  |
  +-- Proof     -> handleProofPacket
  |
  +-- Data      -> handleTransportPacket
                    |
                    +-- ContextPathResponse -> handlePathResponse
                    +-- forwardTransportPacket (type-2 relay)
                    +-- forwardLinkData
                    +-- deliver to Destination.Receive
```

### Header type 2 relay

When transport mode is enabled and the local node acts as a relay, data packets may be rewrapped with header type 2 if the transport ID in the path matches. This matches Python transport relay semantics.

### Announce deduplication

If a destination is already present in the path table, duplicate announces may be dropped per Python 1.3.4 behavior.

## Links at the transport layer

Transport maintains a link table for active sessions. Link packets are routed to the correct `pkg/link` instance. Incoming link requests are dispatched to `link.HandleIncomingLinkRequest` (there is no full Python `Transport.CreateIncomingLink` helper in Go).

## Blackhole interaction

When `pkg/blackhole` has an entry for an identity hash, announces from that identity are dropped. Link teardown at LINKIDENTIFY for blackholed identities is not implemented (gap vs Python 1.3.2). See [Compatibility](/docs/compatibility).

## Transport identity

When `enable_transport = yes`, transport may use a dedicated transport identity stored at `storage/transport_identity`. This identity participates in transport-mode relay and proofs as defined by the protocol.

## Registration API

Typical embedder sequence:

```go
tr := transport.NewTransport(cfg)
tr.Start()

iface, err := interfaces.NewFromConfigWithContext(ctx, name, ifaceCfg)
tr.RegisterInterface(name, iface)
iface.Start()
```

`RegisterInterface` binds the interface packet callback to `HandlePacket`.

Outbound send path:

```go
err := tr.SendPacket(pkt)
```

`SendPacket` looks up the path, may rewrap for relay, serializes, and calls `Interface.Send` on the chosen interface.

## Rate limiting and ingress control

Per-interface `ingress_control` and `announce_rate_*` settings map to token buckets in `pkg/rate`. This mirrors Python 1.2.5 path-request and announce controls.

## Probes

Python supports transport probe responses via `respond_to_probes` and `allow_probes`. These keys are ignored in Reticulum-Go. Probe handling is not ported.

## Debugging

Raise `loglevel` in config. Transport logs at debug levels 5 and above include path updates and forwarding decisions via `pkg/debug`.

## Testing

|-----------|----------|
| Wire parity | `tests/crossref` (path requests, announces, relay) |
| Live relay | `tests/interop/transport_relay_live_test.go` (`RUN_LIVE_INTEROP=1`) |
| Live paths | `tests/interop/transport_path_live_test.go` |
| Property tests | `pkg/transport/*_pbt_test.go` |
| Race tests | `pkg/transport/*_race_test.go` |
