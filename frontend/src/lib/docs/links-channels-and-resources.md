## Overview

Above raw destination packets, Reticulum provides encrypted links for session-oriented communication. On a link you can use:

- Request and response paths
- Reliable channel messages
- Stream buffers (bzip2 compressed)
- Multi-part resource (file) transfers

Packages: `pkg/link`, `pkg/channel`, `pkg/buffer`, `pkg/resource`.

## Links

A link is a bidirectional encrypted session between two destinations.

### Establishing links

**Outbound.** Application opens a link to a destination hash that is already known from an announce or path table.

**Inbound.** Peer sends a link request. Transport dispatches to:

```go
link.HandleIncomingLinkRequest(...)
```

There is no full Python `Transport.CreateIncomingLink` helper stub in Go. Use `HandleIncomingLinkRequest` directly.

### Link lifecycle

```
LINKREQUEST -> LINKIDENTIFY -> LINKREADY -> data / channel / resource
                  |
                  +-> teardown -> LINKCLOSE
```

Links track RTT, keepalive, and proof exchange per protocol rules. `Link.Reestablish` and `WatchAndReconnect` support automatic recovery when `Node.EnableLinkAutoReconnect` or equivalent options are set.

### Request and response

Register a request path on the link or destination. Handlers receive payload bytes and return a response. Timeouts apply if the handler blocks too long.

The control API bridges requests to WebSocket `requestIncomingEvent` and `requestRespondCommand`.

### Path recovery

`pkg/link/link_path_recovery.go` handles path loss during an active link session where the protocol allows recovery.

## Channel

`pkg/channel` provides reliable ordered message delivery inside a link.

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `Channel` | Session over an established link |
| `Envelope` | Wire wrapper for channel messages |
| `MessageBase` | Base type for message payloads |

Python 1.3.0 fixed ghost envelopes on multiple outlets. Go uses a simpler single-outlet model. Wire compatibility for the supported paths is verified in crossref tests.

Typical pattern:

1. Establish link
2. Create channel on link
3. Send and receive `Envelope` messages

## Buffer

`pkg/buffer` implements a stream buffer over a channel.

Use cases:

- Streaming data larger than a single packet
- bzip2-compressed streams with bomb limits matching Python 1.1.9

Entry point:

```go
buf, err := buffer.CreateBidirectionalBuffer(link, ...)
```

Decompression limits protect against malicious compressed payloads. Same limits as Python reference.

## Resources

`pkg/resource` implements multi-part file transfer.

Features:

- Advertisement phase (`Advertisement`)
- Hash map of parts
- RESOURCE_PRF proof flow
- bzip2 compression optional (`bzip2_compress.go`)

Python utility `rncp` is not ported as a CLI. The primitives are available in this package for Go applications.

Transfer flow at a high level:

```
Sender                           Receiver
  |                                  |
  |-- resource advertisement ------->|
  |<-- proof / acceptance -----------|
  |-- parts ------------------------>|
  |<-- proof ------------------------|
  |-- completion -------------------->|
```

## Interaction with transport

Link packets use `PacketTypeLink`. Data packets for link payloads use contexts handled in `Transport.handleTransportPacket` and `forwardLinkData`.

The transport link table tracks which local link object owns each session hash.

## Blackhole gap

Python 1.3.2 tears down links at LINKIDENTIFY when the remote identity is blackholed. Reticulum-Go drops blackholed announces but does not check blackhole status during link identify. See [Compatibility](/docs/compatibility).

## Testing

| Area | Location |
|------|----------|
| Wire parity | `tests/crossref` (links, channel, buffer, resource) |
| Live link interop | `tests/interop/link_live_test.go` |
| Property tests | `pkg/buffer/*_pbt_test.go`, `pkg/resource/*_pbt_test.go` |
| Fuzz | `pkg/link/*_fuzz_test.go` |

## Application guidance

**Keep handlers short.** Request handlers run on link goroutines. Long work should offload to worker pools and respond before timeout.

**One link per peer session.** Multiplex logical streams with channel or buffer instead of opening redundant links.

**Check path before link open.** Outbound links require a known path or successful path request.

**Resource size.** Respect MTU and part sizing. Large files use many parts over the same link.
