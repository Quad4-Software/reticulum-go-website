# Security

## Purpose

This page summarizes security practices for Reticulum-Go. The repository root [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/Quad4-Software/Reticulum-Go/blob/master/SECURITY.md) remains the authoritative source for reporting contacts and detailed CI paths. [Cryptography](/docs/cryptography) covers algorithms and key handling.

## Reporting vulnerabilities

Report security issues privately before public disclosure.

| Channel        | Contact                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Reticulum LXMF | `f489752fbef161c64d65e385a4e9fc74` |
| Email          | `security@quad4.io`                |

Include enough detail to reproduce the issue: component, expected behavior, actual behavior, and environment.

## Threat model (practical summary)

Reticulum-Go assumes:

- Attackers can send arbitrary packets on configured interfaces
- Long-term identity keys must remain confidential
- Operators configure IFAC passphrases and network names as shared secrets for interface segments
- Host OS hardening is the operator responsibility outside the daemon sandbox

The stack provides cryptographic authentication and encryption per the Reticulum protocol. It does not replace firewall policy, physical security, or application-level authorization.

## Runtime sandbox

The `reticulum-go` daemon calls `sandbox.Apply` from `pkg/sandbox` after config load, transport start, shared-instance attach, and Control API bind. Privileged initialization and listeners complete first so FreeBSD CapEnter and OpenBSD pledge do not block those sockets.

Default: `enable_sandbox = yes` in `[reticulum]`. Set `enable_sandbox = no` to disable (not recommended for production).

On Linux, `enable_seccomp` defaults to yes when the sandbox is enabled. Set `enable_seccomp = no` to skip the seccomp filter. Install failures soft-fail so older kernels and constrained environments keep running.

Landlock requires Linux kernel 5.13 or newer. Older kernels skip Landlock gracefully where possible. Seccomp soft-fails on install error or `ENOSYS`.

The WASM build (`reticulum-wasm`) does not use this sandbox. It relies on the browser or host runtime instead.

Sandboxing is defense in depth. It is not a substitute for a MicroVM or strong host isolation. It does not fix weak passphrases, leaked identity files, or misconfigured interfaces.

## Cryptography

All protocol crypto details: [Cryptography](/docs/cryptography).

Application code should use `pkg/cryptography` and `pkg/identity`. IFAC configuration is part of interface security, not a substitute for link encryption.

## Supply chain

**Vendored dependencies.** Third-party source is committed in `vendor/`. Ordinary builds use `GOFLAGS=-mod=vendor` and `GOPROXY=off` so compile time does not fetch modules from the network.

**CI security scans.** GitHub Actions workflows run Gosec, govulncheck, and Trivy. Trivy is installed from a pinned release with SHA256 verification (`scripts/ci/setup-trivy.sh`).

**Reproducibility.** CI includes a reproducibility check (`task reproducibility`).

**Actions pinning.** GitHub-owned actions are pinned to full commit SHAs where this repository pins them.

**Tree integrity.** Root file `reticulum-go.rsm` is an rnid signed message embedding SHA-256 hashes of tracked files (excluding `vendor/` trees). CI verifies signer `e46112d44649266d71fe2193e00a4710` and rechecks bytes at job start and end (`make tree-rsm-verify`).

## Releases

Tagged releases publish from `.github/workflows/publish.yml` on GitHub Actions.

Each release asset has a cosign attestation bundle (`*.cosign.bundle`) signed with the project key. Public key: `cosign.pub` in the repository.

Verify:

```bash
sh scripts/ci/verify-release-attestation.sh PATH/TO/blob PATH/TO/blob.cosign.bundle
```

SHA256 listings in release notes are an informal backup. Prefer cosign verification.

SBOMs (SPDX and CycloneDX) are attached to tagged releases via Trivy (`task sbom`).

## Logging and secrets

- Log destination supports `stderr`, `file`, `both`, `syslog`, `journald`, and combinations such as `syslog+stderr`. Set `logfile` when using a file path.
- High debug levels may print packet hex. Use loglevel 4 or lower in production unless diagnosing an incident.
- `rpc_key` protects the control API and shared-instance RPC. Generate with cryptographic random bytes. Do not commit keys to version control.
- `identity_backend = secretservice` keeps identity private blobs in the desktop keyring (Secret Service) instead of plaintext files. Requires an unlocked session collection.
- `identity_backend = keyring` stores the same blobs in the Linux kernel keyring (no D-Bus), suitable for systemd units. See [Identity and destinations](/docs/identity-and-destinations) for threat coverage.
- Identity private keys are held in locked memory when the OS allows (`pkg/securemem`). This is defense in depth, not a substitute for disk encryption or HSM signing.

## Local mesh health (observe only)

Reticulum-Go keeps node-local integrity and link-health counters in `pkg/health`. They stay on this node. Nothing is flooded to the mesh or sent to a cloud collector.

Counters increment at existing drop and fail sites (IFAC verify, link HMAC, unpack errors, announce signature rejects, link proof rejects, request timestamp skew, blackhole hits, link stale closes, resource stalls, NIC flaps). Accept and reject behavior is unchanged.

Operators see the numbers through:

| Surface                               | What you get                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `reticulum-go status`                 | Per-interface integrity totals and fail rate when non-zero                                      |
| `reticulum-go status -json`           | Same fields in JSON (`ifac_fail`, `hmac_fail`, `integrity_fail_rate`, `stale_closes`, …)        |
| `reticulum-go slow`                   | Scored findings such as `integrity_burst`, `auth_pressure`, `link_degraded`, `ingress_pressure` |
| Control API `GET /v1/status`          | Integrity fields on each interface object                                                       |
| Shared-instance RPC `interface_stats` | Same msgpack keys (Go daemon only populates them)                                               |

Scoring prefers fail ratios and bitrate-aware thresholds. High latency alone on a low-bitrate radio is not treated as critical. There is no auto blackhole or auto interface offline in this release. The operator decides whether to adjust IFAC keys, enable ingress control, blackhole an identity, or take an interface down.

See [CLI utilities](/docs/utilities) for `status` and `slow`, and [Control API](/docs/control-api) for HTTP fields.

## Control API exposure

The control API binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. It is disabled unless `enable_control_api = yes`. Do not expose it to untrusted networks without additional TLS and auth layers (not provided by this package).

## BZ2 bomb limits

Resource and buffer decompression enforce size limits aligned with Python 1.1.9 to resist compression bombs.

## Hop field validation (RNS 1.3.8)

Python RNS 1.3.8 rejects packets whose hop byte is `>= PATHFINDER_M` (128) during unpack. Reticulum-Go mirrors that in `pkg/packet.Unpack`. Values 128 through 255 are dropped before transport processing.

Link establishment also records `expected_hops` on both initiator and responder. Initiator LRPROOF acceptance requires the proof hop count to match (or `expected_hops == PATHFINDER_M` when the path length was unknown at link creation), matching Python `Transport` pending-link gating.
