# Configuration

## Overview

Reticulum-Go reads the same INI-style configuration shape as Python Reticulum. The canonical parser lives in pkg/reticulumconfig. The daemon imports it through internal/config.

Default config path:

```
~/.reticulum-go/config
```

Override with --config on the daemon command line.

## Config directory layout

```
~/.reticulum-go/
  config
  storage/
    identities/
    cache/
      announces/
    resources/
    ratchets/
    blackhole
    destination_table
    known_destinations/
    transport_identity
    dos_protect.mpack
```

Python uses ~/.reticulum or /etc/reticulum by default. Reticulum-Go uses a separate directory so both stacks can run on one host.

storage/ratchets/ holds known-peer public keys named by destination hash (Python {'{'}ratchet, received{'}'} msgpack) and destination-private signed lists at the path EnableRatchets was given. Pageserver names that file by destination hash, same as Python LXMF. EnableRatchetsInMemory and in_memory_storage keep ratchet material in RAM.

Local overload gates in pkg/protect. They keep **this node** alive under floods and resource storms. They do not ban peers mesh-wide and do not replace IFAC, link crypto, or Sybil-resistant admission policy.

| Mode                         | Behavior                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| off                          | Disabled                                                                                                                |
| detect (alias ids)           | Trip, count, and rate-limited stdout warnings. Traffic still flows                                                      |
| prevent (aliases block, ips) | Same as detect, and shed or block on trip                                                                               |
| auto (alias smart)           | Learn quietly, then arm prevent. Relearn on interface fingerprint change or sustained moderate drift. Floods stay armed |

Default is off. Mesh announce and path-request filtering still runs in Transport regardless of this key. Turn detect or auto on only after you have watched a busy node, and prevent only if you accept local shedding.

Example (opt-in):

```
[reticulum]
  dos_protection = auto
```

Learning state is written as msgpack to {'{'}config_dir{'}'}/storage/dos_protect.mpack (atomic replace). Restarts restore armed baselines when the interface fingerprint still matches.

Optional limits (zero or unset keeps built-in defaults):

| Key               | Purpose                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| dos_max_pps       | Absolute per-iface packet rate ceiling     |
| dos_max_bps       | Absolute per-iface byte rate ceiling       |
| dos_floor_pps     | Minimum adaptive trip line (pps)           |
| dos_floor_bps     | Minimum adaptive trip line (bps)           |
| dos_max_conns     | Concurrent stream accepts per iface        |
| dos_max_resources | Concurrent incoming resources process-wide |
| dos_max_crypto    | Concurrent crypto verify jobs              |
| dos_max_handshake | Concurrent link handshake jobs             |

Ingress uses interface bitrate when available to scale adaptive floors. Announce-class traffic sheds at the adaptive trip line. Path requests, data, and established link or proof traffic may stay admitted above that line (up to 2x, or the advertised bitrate if higher). That band does not arm interface cool-down. Interface-wide cool-down is off by default so a public UDP listener is not blackholed. A single flooder can still be peer-cooled.

Operator visibility: reticulum-go status -json and shared-instance interface_stats include a protect object (mode, phase, trip lines, cool-down). Control API GET /v1/status includes the same protect block.

Surfaces gated when mode is not off:

| Iface cool-down            | Opt-in 15s hard reject after a burst of trips on one iface. Off by default so a public UDP listener is not blackholed |

Stdout trip lines look like:

WARNING: dos_protection auto/learning trip reason=pps iface=udp0
WARNING: dos_protection auto promote reason=stable phase=armed
WARNING: dos_protection auto relearn reason=network phase=learning
```

Health kinds dos_* increment on trips. See [Security](/docs/security#dos-protection-local-idsips) and [Development and testing](/docs/development-and-testing#dos_protection-tests).

### Keys present in Python but ignored in Go

None for blackhole federation or discovery autoconnect. Those keys are driven in Go.

local_hops_delta applies a random hop field (2-7) on locally originated hop-0 packets when not connected to a shared instance.

## Section [logging]

| Key         | Supported                                                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| loglevel    | Yes (0 silent, 1 critical, 2 error, 3 warning, 4 info, 5 verbose, 6 trace, 7 packets) |
| destination | Yes (stderr, file, both, syslog, journald, and combinations such as syslog+stderr)    |
| logfile     | Yes (default {'{'}config_dir{'}'}/logfile/reticulum.log)                                      |
| format      | Yes (text or json)                                                                    |

Default loglevel is 4 (info). That prints start/stop, interface up/down, and link established/closed. It does not print per-packet forwarding.

| loglevel | Name     | Typical content                             |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 0        | silent   | nothing                                     |
| 1        | critical | fatal conditions                            |
| 2        | error    | failed operations                           |
| 3        | warning  | recovered problems (bad signature, timeout) |
| 4        | info     | operator lifecycle (default)                |
| 5        | verbose  | per-session protocol detail                 |
| 6        | trace    | per-packet headers and forwarding           |
| 7        | packets  | wire dumps and packet hex                   |

CLI -debug N overrides config for one run (0 through 7). Hot paths skip argument formatting unless the active level would emit the line.

## Interface blocks [[Name]]

Each block defines one interface. Common keys:

## Example: TCP client with IFAC

```ini
[[Gateway]]
type = TCPClientInterface
enabled = yes
target_host = mesh.example.com
target_port = 7825
network_name = MyMesh
passphrase = long-random-secret
ifac_size = 16
max_reconnect_tries = 0
```

max_reconnect_tries = 0 means no reconnect attempts after disconnect. Omit the key or set -1 for unlimited retries.

## Example: QUIC client and server

```ini
[[QUIC Hub]]
type = QUICServerInterface
enabled = yes
listen_ip = 0.0.0.0
listen_port = 4242

[[QUIC Uplink]]
type = QUICClientInterface
enabled = yes
target_host = hub.example.com
target_port = 4242
peer_key = aabbccddeeff00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff00112233445566778899
max_reconnect_tries = -1
```

QUIC is Go-only. TLS uses ephemeral self-signed certificates by default. Set peer_key to the remote leaf SPKI SHA-256 (hex) to pin the peer. Optional cert_file / key_file and sni are supported. Not available on WASM.

## Example: AutoInterface on Wi-Fi

```ini
[reticulum]
watch_interfaces = yes

[[WiFi Mesh]]
type = AutoInterface
enabled = yes
interface = wlan0
discovery_port = 35615
data_port = 35616
```

watch_interfaces rescans NICs when link state changes and helps AutoInterface follow Wi-Fi roam events.

## Example: PipeInterface subprocess bridge

```ini
[[Radio Bridge]]
type = PipeInterface
enabled = yes
command = /opt/mesh/radio-bridge --stdio
respawn_delay = 5
```

Reticulum writes HDLC-framed packets to the subprocess stdin and reads frames from stdout. When the subprocess exits, the interface respawns after respawn_delay seconds.

## Example: shared-instance RPC for Go CLI tools

On Linux, unset shared_instance_type uses abstract Unix sockets (@rns/&lt;instance_name&gt;/rpc), matching stock Python rnsd. Go utilities try that default first, then fall back to TCP when the type is unset.

```bash
make build
./bin/reticulum-go status -config ~/.reticulum -json
```

Optional shared auth (recommended when mixing stacks):

```ini
[reticulum]
share_instance = yes
instance_name = default
shared_instance_type = unix
rpc_key = <64 hex characters>
```

Use shared_instance_type = tcp with instance_control_port when you want TCP on every OS. Use -config ~/.reticulum for Python rnsd and -config ~/.reticulum-go for a Go shared instance. Full utility docs are in [CLI utilities](/docs/utilities).

## Example: explicit LocalInterface client

When share_instance = no, attach to another process that owns the shared instance:

```ini
[reticulum]
share_instance = no

[[Local]]
type = LocalInterface
enabled = yes
port = 37428
shared_instance_type = tcp
```

## Hot reload

On Unix the daemon reloads interface blocks on SIGHUP via node.ReloadInterfaces. Reload compares normalized config for each interface including MTU, bitrate, prefer_ipv6, announce-rate, ingress/egress control, mode, and outgoing. See [Interfaces](/docs/interfaces).

## Programmatic access

```go
import "quad4/reticulum-go/pkg/reticulumconfig"

cfg, err := reticulumconfig.LoadConfig("/path/to/config")
```

Defaults without a file:

```go
cfg := reticulumconfig.DefaultConfig()
```

Save:

```go
err := reticulumconfig.SaveConfig(cfg)
```

## Storage and identity files

Identity files use a 64-byte software layout (X25519 private plus Ed25519 seed). Reticulum-Go stores identity blobs under storage/identities/ keyed by hash. Python may use per-name files. Both layouts are supported for loading.

Optional hardware-bound descriptors (RHB1, 72 bytes) are documented in [Identity and destinations](/docs/identity-and-destinations).
