# Control API

## Scope

pkg/controlapi exposes a localhost JSON and WebSocket API so applications in any language can use Reticulum destinations, announces, links, and requests without embedding the Go transport stack.

The server is optional and disabled by default.

## Architecture notes

The mesh is destinations, announces, and links between peers. No node is privileged on the wire. Upstream design intent: [Zen of Reticulum](https://reticulum.network/manual/zen.html).

The Control API is a local HTTP/WebSocket front end for one reticulum-go process. It is not the mesh. Apps that treat this API as a required remote service reintroduce a single control host even when RNS routing stays peer-to-peer.

**Appropriate uses**

- Tools and UIs on the same host as the daemon
- App logic in another language while the daemon owns transport
- Lab or ops access on loopback (or a private network you fully control)

**Avoid**

- A public Control API endpoint that clients must use to participate
- Putting identity, routing, or app policy behind one always-on control host
- Large transfers via base64 link.send_resource when rncp or in-process librns is available
- Binding off loopback and describing the result as decentralized because RNS is underneath

If the product fails when the Control API host is unreachable, the product depends on that host. Prefer peer destinations and links for application traffic. Keep this API on the machine that runs the node.

## Enable in config

```ini
[reticulum]
enable_control_api = yes
rpc_key = <64 hex characters>
control_api_host = 127.0.0.1
control_api_port = 37430
# Optional extra listener. TCP stays enabled.
# control_api_socket = /run/reticulum-go/control.sock
```

rpc_key is a 32-byte value encoded as hex. The same key authenticates shared-instance RPC when configured.

Generate a key with a cryptographic random source. Example using OpenSSL:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

## Authentication

All /v1 routes require:

```
Authorization: Bearer <hex rpc_key>
```

Requests without a valid bearer token are rejected.

These counters are local observability only. They do not change packet accept or reject policy. For scored findings use reticulum-go slow. For a full path and health dump use reticulum-go snapshot.

## Sessions

A session owns:

- One identity
- Destinations registered under that identity
- Links opened or accepted by the session

Typical flow:

```
POST /v1/sessions
  -> session id

POST /v1/sessions/{id}/destinations
  -> register app destination

POST /v1/sessions/{id}/destinations/{hash}/announce
  -> publish announce

GET /v1/sessions/{id}/events (WebSocket)
  -> subscribe to announces, links, requests
```

## WebSocket events

Full type definitions: pkg/controlapi/protocol.go.

## Links via API

Register a destination with link acceptance enabled for inbound links.

Outbound: send link.open over the events WebSocket. The server waits a bitrate-sized path window, then starts handshake. link.established or link.failed follows. Do not apply a flat 15 second client timer. The wait_s field from POST .../path/request is the window to show in UI if you request a path yourself.

Both directions receive link.established when ready, then link.data for peer data.

Use link.identify after the link is active. The peer receives link.remote_identified.

## Requests via API

Register a request path with POST .../destinations/{hash}/requests. Incoming requests appear as request.incoming. Respond with request.respond before the handler timeout.

Outbound: after link.established, send link.request. Completion arrives as request.response or request.failed.

Handlers block the underlying link goroutine until response or timeout. Keep processing short.

Deregister with DELETE .../requests?path=/your/path.

## Resources via API

link.send_resource mirrors librns minimal resource send. Expect resource.started and resource.concluded on the peer. Payloads are base64 over WebSocket, so large files are memory-heavy. Prefer rncp or in-process librns for bulk transfers.

## Scope and caveats

This API is an application contract for destinations, announces, links, requests, identify, and minimal resources. It is not a full mirror of channels, stream buffers, resource cancel/progress, or mesh-admin ops (drop path, blackhole). Those stay on shared-instance RPC and CLI.

Control API /v1 is independent of librns RNS_API_VERSION. Additive JSON fields and new type strings are the compatibility model.

WebSocket event delivery is best-effort. A full client outbox drops events.

See [Architecture notes](#architecture-notes) when designing a product on top of this API.

## Example client

examples/control-client/client.py is a Python reference client for the API.

## Security notes

- Default bind is loopback only
- Do not expose the control API to untrusted networks without additional protection
- Treat rpc_key as a secret comparable to an API token
- Binding off loopback for convenience fights the model in [Architecture notes](#architecture-notes)
- See [Security](/docs/security)

## Dart and Flutter

Path: bindings/dart/ (package rns_control).

### Control API client

HTTP and WebSocket client for a local or LAN reticulum-go daemon. Import package:rns_control/rns_control.dart.

```dart
import 'package:rns_control/rns_control.dart';

final client = ControlClient(rpcKey: rpcKey);
final session = await client.createSession();
final events = client.openEvents(session.sessionId);
events.subscribeAnnounces();
```

Coverage includes health, status (with integrity counters), paths, sessions, destinations, announce, request handlers (register and deregister), lifecycle, outbound requests, resources, identify, and WebSocket commands or events. Authenticated WebSocket upgrades require dart:io (Flutter mobile or desktop). Browser clients cannot set the Authorization header on WebSocket.

### In-process FFI

For embedding without a daemon, use package:rns_control/ffi.dart over librns on Linux, Android, and Windows. See [librns Dart FFI](/docs/librns#dart-ffi-bindings).

```bash
task build-librns
task test-dart
# or
make -C bindings/dart test
```

Add to a Flutter app with a path dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  rns_control:
    path: ../Reticulum-Go/bindings/dart
```
